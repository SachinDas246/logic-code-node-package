# Logic Code 

Logic code is currently in demo and will have issues.  


Logic code is a tool to represent , design and simulate logic circuit.It allows users to write code in logic code format and transpile it to c++ code for execution.

Check out here [Logic code](https://sachindas246.github.io/logic-code-doc/)

## Features
* ##### Module based  
Every component/system in logic code is built out of modules. You can use existing modules or create your own.  

* ##### Simulation  
Logic code provide the users to simulate the logic circuit but converting the circuit into a c++ code. Which can be compiled to an executable to run the project.

* #####  Support for automatic build  
Not everybody likes C++ and Make. So logic code transpiler take care of Makefile generation and build for you.
